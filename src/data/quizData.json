For example, in a water molecule, the oxygen atom \u201cpulls\u201d a bit harder on the shared electrons than the hydrogen atom. As a result, the hydrogen end of the water molecule becomes slightly positively-charged, while the oxygen end of the water molecule becomes slightly negatively-charged. The positively-charged end of one water molecule can then become weakly attracted to the negatively-charged end of a second water molecule. This weak attraction between two polar molecules is called hydrogen bonding."
